Description: Graduate students new to both PhD level econometrics and **R** may find the 
    introduction to both challenging. One major challenge can be finding the empirical 
    data to complete a Problem Set and then loading it into **R**. The `hayashir` data 
    package intends to lighten the load on Graduate Student and users of Hayashi's 
    text "Econometrics". The package contains documentation for each data set and all 
    data used in the book is included. Once the package is installed and loaded, all 
    data sets are ready to use, with minimal fuss.
